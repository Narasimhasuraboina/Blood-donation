About cors:-
In simple terms, the cors middleware is a security gatekeeper you explicitly authorize to allow your frontend and backend to talk to each other without the browser panicking.

About Axios:
Why do we need it?
Your app usually has:
Frontend (React / JS)
Backend (Node / Express / PHP)
Database (MySQL)
Frontend cannot directly talk to the database ❌
So it talks to the backend API using HTTP requests.
👉 Axios helps send those requests easily
One-line memory trick 🧠
Axios = messenger between frontend and backend
